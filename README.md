# eslint-config-krauter â€“ TypeScript Code ESLint Config

Hey, what's up, tech enthusiasts? Welcome to the **eslint-config-krauter**! ðŸš€

We've got something awesome for all you TypeScript aficionados out there. This isn't just any old code formatting setup â€“ we're talking top-tier, pixel-perfect, A-grade TypeScript awesomeness. At least, that is the goal. Drop an issue if you have suggestions to raise the bar.

## Shared Code Linting: Why It Matters

Picture this: you're working on a project with a dream team of developers. Each developer has their unique coding style, and while diversity is great, a lack of consistent code formatting can turn your masterpiece into a hotbed of confusion. Enter shared code linting configuration.

A shared code linting configuration like ours is the secret sauce that keeps your codebase cohesive and your team in sync. It's not just about aesthetics; it's about making sure your code is readable, maintainable, and devoid of those pesky bugs that creep in due to inconsistent practices.

With a shared linting setup, you're creating a universal language that everyone on your team can understand. That means fewer head-scratching moments, faster onboarding for new team members, and the ability to spot issues before they become problems.

## Quick Start

So, you're ready to dive in? Let's roll!

1. First things first, grab this package using your favorite package manager:

   ```bash
   npm install @your-org/eslint-config-typescript --save-dev
   # or
   yarn add @your-org/eslint-config-typescript --dev
   ```

2. Next up, you'll want to create an `.eslintrc.js` file right at the root of your project:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     extends: '@your-org/eslint-config-typescript',
     // Feel free to add any extra project-specific rules or configurations here
   };
   ```

3. Bam! That's it! Your code is now rockin' those shared TypeScript code formatting rules.

## Call the Shots

Customization is key, right? Feel free to twist those rules to your liking. Just tweak the `.eslintrc.js` file you made earlier and show those rules who's boss.

## Add `package.json` Scripts

Want some extra magic? Add these scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"
  }
}
```

Now, you're the captain of your ship. Run `npm run lint` to check your code for issues and `npm run lint:fix` to zap away some of those nasties.
